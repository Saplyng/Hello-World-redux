I'm Saplyng, preferred alias, if you see it anywhere, you can bet that it's actually me.

New to coding world, it's frankly overwhelming, like coming into an established country without
knowing it's history. It can be daunting to learn it all at once.

I hope to make apps, android preferred but iOS has the real money, it's a small goal but it's mine.

Nice to meet you.
