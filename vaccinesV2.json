            "description": "Shake well before use. With thorough agitation, ENGERIX-B is a homogeneous, turbid white suspension. Do not administer if it appears otherwise. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.For the prefilled syringes, attach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly.For the vials, use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to withdraw the vaccine dose and administer intramuscularly. Changing needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. ENGERIX-B should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred administration site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for infants younger than 1 year and the deltoid muscle in older children (whose deltoid is large enough for an intramuscular injection) and adults. ENGERIX-B should not be administered in the gluteal region; such injections may result in suboptimal response. ENGERIX-B may be administered subcutaneously to persons at risk of hemorrhage (e.g., hemophiliacs). However, hepatitis B vaccines administered subcutaneously are known to result in a lower antibody response. Additionally, when other aluminum-adsorbed vaccines have been administered subcutaneously, an increased incidence of local reactions including subcutaneous nodules has been observed. Therefore, subcutaneous administration should be used only in persons who are at risk of hemorrhage with intramuscular injections. Do not administer this product intravenously or intradermally. Persons from Birth through 19 YearsPrimary immunization for infants (born of hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg]-negative or HBsAg-positive mothers), children (birth through 10 years), and adolescents (aged 11 through 19 years) consists of a series of 3 doses ( 0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Persons Aged 20 Years and OlderPrimary immunization for persons aged 20 years and older consists of a series of 3 doses ( 1 mLeach) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Adults on HemodialysisPrimary immunization consists of a series of 4 doses ( 2-  mL each) given as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 6-month schedule. In hemodialysis patients, antibody response is lower than in healthy persons and protection may persist only as long as antibody levels remain above 10 mIU/mL. Therefore, the need for booster doses should be assessed by annual antibody testing. A 2-mL booster dose (as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses) should be given when antibody levels decline below 10 mIU/mL.",

Parenteral drug products should be  inspected  visually  for  particulate  matter  or  discoloration prior to administration.Dosing Schedules: The usual immunization regimen consists of three doses of vaccine given according to the following schedule: 1st dose: at elected date; 2nd dose: 1 month after 1st dose; 3rd dose: 6 months after first dose.There is an alternate schedule with injections at 0, 1 and 2 months designed for certain populations (e.g., neonates born of hepatitis B infected mothers, others who have or might have been recently exposed to the virus,). On this alternate schedule, an additional dose at 12 months is recommended for infants born of infected mothers and for others for whom prolonged maintenance  of  protective  titers  is  desired.For hemodialysis patients, in whom vaccine-induced protection is less complete and may persist only as long as antibody levels remain above 10 mIU/mL, the need for booster doses should be assessed by annual  antibody  testing.  40  mcg  (two  -  20  mcg)  booster doses with Amvax-B should be given when antibody  levels  decline  below  10  mIU/mL.Known or presumed exposure to hepatitis B virus: Unprotected individuals with known or presumed exposure to the hepatitis B virus (e.g., neonates born of  infected  mothers,  others  experiencing  percutaneous or permucosal exposure) should be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in addition to   Amvax-B   in   accordance   with   ACIP   recommendations and with the package insert of HBIG.",
