Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.For the prefilled syringes, attach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly.For the vials, use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to withdraw the vaccine dose and administer intramuscularly. Changing needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. ENGERIX-B should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred administration site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for infants younger than 1 year and the deltoid muscle in older children (whose deltoid is large enough for an intramuscular injection) and adults. ENGERIX-B should not be administered in the gluteal region; such injections may result in suboptimal response. ENGERIX-B may be administered subcutaneously to persons at risk of hemorrhage (e.g., hemophiliacs). However, hepatitis B vaccines administered subcutaneously are known to result in a lower antibody response. Additionally, when other aluminum-adsorbed vaccines have been administered subcutaneously, an increased incidence of local reactions including subcutaneous nodules has been observed. Therefore, subcutaneous administration should be used only in persons who are at risk of hemorrhage with intramuscular injections. Do not administer this product intravenously or intradermally. Persons from Birth through 19 YearsPrimary immunization for infants (born of hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg]-negative or HBsAg-positive mothers), children (birth through 10 years), and adolescents (aged 11 through 19 years) consists of a series of 3 doses ( 0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Persons Aged 20 Years and OlderPrimary immunization for persons aged 20 years and older consists of a series of 3 doses ( 1 mLeach) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Adults on HemodialysisPrimary immunization consists of a series of 4 doses ( 2-  mL each) given as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 6-month schedule. In hemodialysis patients, antibody response is lower than in healthy persons and protection may persist only as long as antibody levels remain above 10 mIU/mL. Therefore, the need for booster doses should be assessed by annual antibody testing. A 2-mL booster dose (as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses) should be given when antibody levels decline below 10 mIU/mL.",

More than 3 does of the vaccine are not required, regardless of duration (>4 weeks) of the interval between them. Recommended schedules for vaccination can be divided into those that include a birth-dose and those that do not. Schedules with a birth-dose call for the first vaccination at birth (within 24 hours), followed by a second and third dose at the time of the first and third diptheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination, respectively. Alternatively, a four-dose schedule may be used where the dose at birth is followed by three additional doses; theses doses may be given either as monovalent vaccine or as a combination (e.g. with DTP and/or Hib) following the schedules commonly used for those vaccines. These schedules will prevent most perinatally acquired infection. Hepatitis B vaccine can be given safely and effectively at the same time as BCG, DTP, measles, polio (OPV or IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type be, or yellow fever vaccines or vitamin A supplementation.
