# Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as
# key-value pairs. THe program should display a menu that lets the user look up
# a person's email address, add a new name and email address, change an
# existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address. The
# program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file when the user
# exits the program. Each time the program starts, it should retrieve the
# dictionary from the file and unpickle it.
