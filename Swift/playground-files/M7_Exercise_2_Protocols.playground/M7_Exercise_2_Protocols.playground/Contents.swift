 ## Module 7 Exercise 2 -- Protocols
 *For each of the numbered steps in the comments, add the code requested on the line(s) below the instruction.*
 1. Create a *structure* that defines a Point having Double x and y values.
 */


//: 2. Create a Circle *class* that includes a Point object for its center and a Double value for its radius. The center point should default to (0.0, 0.0) and the radius should always have a positive value.


//: 3. Create an *extension* to the Circle class that implements the == function defined in the Equatable *protocol*. Depending upon your implementation, you may need to make an adjustment to the Point struct for protocol compliance. Equatable protocol documentation can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/equatable?changes=_3).


//: 4. Create two Circle objects and test them for equality using the == operator.
